## â˜ª Start

The project was configured using Babel, which is responsible for converting the React code with modern JavaScript (ECMA6 +) to a code compatible with old browsers.
The Webpack was configured to interpret each type of file, through loaders.

After cloned the project (git clone https://bitbucket.org/lucasvianacunha/marvel.git) use the command:

### `yarn`

For the installation of the project facilities (package.json).

At the root of the project, use the command:

### `yarn dev`

This will start the development server at the address [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To use the system in production use the command:

### `yarn build`

This will start the production server.

### `yarn flow`

This command uses the flow type for type validation.

### Application link in production:

https://lucas-marvel.netlify.app/
